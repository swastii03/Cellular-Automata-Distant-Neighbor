# Cellular-Automata-Distant-Neighbor

This repository contains the Python implementation and analysis framework for studying the role of distant neighbour interactions in Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA). The project investigates the influence of binary operations (XOR, OR, AND, NAND, NOR, XNOR) between a cell and its distant neighbour on the dynamics of ECA rules across Classes II, III, and IV.

The results explore patterns, robustness, and emergent behaviours through visualization techniques such as spacetime diagrams, density plots, and heatmaps. This study also provides a robust classification of ECA rules based on these interactions.
